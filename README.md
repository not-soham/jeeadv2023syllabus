>General Units and dimensions, dimensional analysis; least count, significant figures; Methods of 
measurement and error analysis for physical quantities pertaining to the following experiments: 
Experiments based on using Vernier calipers and screw gauge (micrometer), Determination of g 
using simple pendulum, Young’s modulus - elasticity of the material Surface tension of water by 
capillary rise and effect of detergents. Specific heat of a liquid using calorimeter, focal length of a 
concave mirror and a convex lens using u-v method, Speed of sound using resonance column, 
Verification of Ohm’s law using voltmeter and ammeter, and specific resistance of the material of 
a wire using meter bridge and post office box.
